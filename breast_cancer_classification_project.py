# **Predicting Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Supervised Machine Learning**
### **Overview**
Breast cancer is a critical global health concern, and early detection significantly improves patient outcomes. This project leverages supervised machine learning techniques to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign based on diagnostic data. Using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)** dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we aim to create predictive models to assist healthcare professionals in making timely decisions.

---

### **Problem Statement**
This project focuses on building machine learning models to classify breast tumors into two categories:
- **Malignant (M):** Cancerous tumors that require immediate intervention.
- **Benign (B):** Non-cancerous tumors with minimal risk.

We will explore various machine learning techniques to determine the best-performing model for accurate predictions.

---

### **Significance**
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality among women globally. Machine learning offers the potential to assist in early detection, reducing mortality rates, and improving quality of life for patients. By analyzing a reliable dataset and building robust models, this project seeks to contribute to advancing AI applications in medical diagnostics.

"""## **Dataset Analysis**
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset offers a robust platform for developing machine learning models. To further understand the data and prepare it for model building, this section provides deeper insights into feature distributions, target balance, and correlations among variables.

---

### **1. Target Distribution**
The target variable `Diagnosis` indicates whether a tumor is malignant (`M`) or benign (`B`). It is crucial to check the distribution of these classes to ensure balanced representation, as imbalanced datasets may require specific handling techniques.

---

### **2. Feature Analysis**
The dataset includes 30 numerical features representing different characteristics of cell nuclei. We will:
- Visualize the distribution of key features.
- Investigate correlations among features to identify redundancies or strong relationships.
- Check for variability in the data to ensure all features contribute meaningfully to the models.

---

### **3. Statistical Insights**
Summary statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, help understand the spread and central tendencies of the features. These insights guide data preprocessing, such as normalization and scaling.

"""# Conclusion of Dataset Analysis

From the dataset analysis, we derive several crucial insights that lay the groundwork for the modeling phase:

1. **Target Variable Balance**:
   - The dataset contains a higher count of benign cases compared to malignant cases. This imbalance should be considered during model evaluation and training to avoid bias towards the majority class. *(Refer to the earlier distribution plot for details.)*

2. **Feature Analysis**:
   - Many features exhibit a strong correlation with each other, such as radius, perimeter, and area. This indicates potential redundancy, which can be addressed during feature selection or dimensionality reduction.
   - Features have varying ranges and distributions, which suggests the need for normalization or standardization to ensure all features contribute equally during model training.

3. **Statistical Insights**:
   - The summary statistics reveal the central tendencies and variabilities of key features, providing guidance for preprocessing techniques like scaling.

These findings emphasize the need for thoughtful preprocessing and robust model evaluation strategies to account for class imbalance and potential feature redundancies.

"""## Summary of Key Findings

1. **Feature Distributions**:
   - Features such as `radius1`, `area1`, and `perimeter1` exhibit positively skewed distributions, with potential outliers observed in `area1` and `perimeter1`.
   - Most features show a significant range of values, indicating the need for scaling or normalization in preprocessing.

2. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Strong correlations exist between features like `radius1`, `perimeter1`, and `area1`, suggesting possible redundancy. Dimensionality reduction or feature selection might be considered.
   - Features like `fractal_dimension1` exhibit lower correlations with others, making them potentially useful for capturing unique patterns.

3. **Target Variable**:
   - The target variable (`Diagnosis`) indicates a class imbalance, with benign cases (B) being more frequent than malignant ones (M). This imbalance may require handling techniques such as oversampling or using balanced metrics during evaluation.

4. **Relationships**:
   - Scatter plots reveal that features such as `radius1` and `area1` provide clear separation between malignant (M) and benign (B) cases. Patients with higher values for these features are more likely to have malignant tumors.
   - Some overlap is observed for features like `texture1`, which may require additional feature engineering to improve separation.

5. **Key Recommendations**:
   - **Preprocessing Steps**: Apply scaling or normalization due to the varying scales of features and their large ranges.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Focus on highly correlated features (`radius1`, `area1`, `perimeter1`) to avoid multicollinearity in modeling.
   - **Imbalance Handling**: Address the class imbalance in the target variable using oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) or algorithm-level adjustments.

## Additional Analysis: Statistical Tests and Density Plots

To further enhance the insights gained from EDA, this section includes:

1. **Skewness Analysis**:
   - Statistical measurement of skewness for numerical features to quantify asymmetry in their distributions.
   - Identification of features requiring transformation (e.g., log, square root).

2. **Density Plots**:
   - Visualizing the distribution of key features separately for malignant and benign cases.
   - Providing a better understanding of feature separability between the classes.

"""### Interpretation of Results

#### Density Plots:
- The density plots demonstrate a clear distinction in key features (e.g., `radius1`, `perimeter1`, and `area1`) between malignant and benign cases.
- Applying log transformation, as seen for `area1`, effectively reduces skewness and enhances the separation between the two classes.
- Features such as `radius1` and `perimeter1` exhibit distinct patterns, making them strong candidates for feature selection during modeling.

#### Skewness Analysis:
- Several features exhibit high skewness (e.g., `area1`, `area2`, `perimeter2`, and `radius2`), which could benefit from transformations to normalize their distributions.
- Log transformation successfully reduces skewness for `area1`, as shown in the updated density plot.

# 5. Model Building

In this section, we will:
1. Train a **Logistic Regression** model as the baseline, providing a simple and interpretable benchmark.
2. Train and optimize advanced models, including:
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Split the data into training and testing sets for evaluation.
4. Use metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC** to evaluate the models and compare their performance.

Hyperparameter tuning will be performed for advanced models using **GridSearchCV** or **RandomizedSearchCV** to identify optimal configurations.

### Step 1: Split Data into Training and Testing Sets

- The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing sets using `train_test_split`.
- Stratification is applied to maintain class balance in both sets.
- Class distributions in the training and testing sets are logged to verify stratification.

#### Observations:

### Introduction

In this step, we aim to establish a robust baseline for our binary classification task using **Logistic Regression**, a simple yet powerful algorithm. Logistic Regression serves as an excellent starting point due to its interpretability, scalability, and ability to handle both linear and non-linear relationships when combined with feature engineering techniques like polynomial transformations. This baseline provides a foundation for benchmarking and evaluating advanced models.

### Key Components of the Process

1. **Model Training**:
   - Train a **Logistic Regression** model to establish baseline performance metrics.
   - Use **Polynomial Feature Transformations** to uncover potential non-linear relationships and feature interactions that may improve performance.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Utilize `GridSearchCV` for an exhaustive and systematic exploration of hyperparameters:
     - **Polynomial Degree**: Tests for varying levels of feature complexity by including polynomial terms up to the fourth degree.
     - **Interaction Terms**: Determines whether to consider only interaction terms or all polynomial combinations.
     - **Regularization Strength (C)**: Adjusts the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting.
     - **Optimization Solvers**: Tests different optimization methods (`liblinear`, `lbfgs`, `saga`) for efficient convergence.
     - **Class Weighting**: Balances the model to mitigate the impact of class imbalance during training.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Precision**: Measures the ratio of true positives to all predicted positives, evaluating the model’s accuracy for positive predictions.
   - **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Reflects the model's ability to identify all true positive cases in the dataset.
   - **F1-Score**: Provides a harmonic mean of precision and recall, especially useful for imbalanced datasets.
   - **ROC-AUC**: Assesses the model’s ability to discriminate between classes across all classification thresholds.

4. **Visualization**:
   - A **Confusion Matrix** to display the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
   - A **ROC Curve** to visualize the trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity at various threshold levels.

### Why Logistic Regression?
